Summary: Week 19

* Completely useless but extremely fun, a [terminal animated pomodoro timer with an ASCII cat](https://github.com/meoowe/blipsy). Really love it ðŸ˜†

* [Tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei), a program to show statistics about your code. Nice CLI output.

* I'm looking at how to get my Office 365 calendar information in a python application and I found the library [python-o365](https://github.com/O365/python-o365). I'm surprised it even works, knowing MS.

* A [Bluesky thread](https://bsky.app/profile/jesslynnrose.bsky.social/post/3lonc77bckc2l) with unusual, weird, niche, alt websites. Didn't go through them all but I love discovering these kind of gems.

* [The Internet can be good](https://www.todepond.com/sky/the-internet-can-be-good/): half desesperate attempt to say there's still hope.

> we live in a system where the more money you have, the more likely it is that youâ€™re a massive cunt. this means that the internet is a manifestation of the biggest cunts of humankind. this means that the internet is bad.

* An article that passed around my feeds - [It's the system, stupid](https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2025/05/11/its-the-system-stupid/). Tries to make a case that we should not use AI for coding but for reviewing, lint, etc. You don't already do that? Github has even a thing called Github Copilot bot... Still some good points in there.

* Instead of fixing their web app streaming and sharing issues on Linux, MS has decided to implement [another useless feature](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-teams-will-soon-block-screen-capture-during-meetings/). Probably another attempt to force people to use "supported clients" (read: less and less web app support, for non-Windows platforms). God I hate MS management.

* You can play the lottery or [be a bug bounty hunter knowing git internals](https://medium.com/@sharon.brizinov/how-i-made-64k-from-deleted-files-a-bug-bounty-story-c5bd3a6f5f9b). Only one choice can bring money, it seems.

* They're owned by MS but they seem to still be good people? (How long will it last?) Github make some changes in their amazing CLI `gh` [to make it more accessible](https://github.blog/engineering/user-experience/building-a-more-accessible-github-cli/).

That's all, folks!
