Summary: Week 23

A bit late to write about last week interesting tech discoveries and articles. But hey, I do what I want.

But boy, it goes fast these days...

## Tools

* A [React ebook reader](https://github.com/readest/readest)? Anything is possible with web apps.

* The [Party parrot](https://github.com/hugomd/parrot.live?tab=readme-ov-file) and [ascii.live](ascii.live) put some groove in your terminal.

* `git-who` has released [version 1.1](https://github.com/sinclairtarget/git-who/releases). Make stats in the terminal.

* A Rust tool to generate beautiful code snapshots and provides both a CLI and a library: [codesnap](https://github.com/codesnap-rs/codesnap?tab=readme-ov-file)

* [Crowdbook](https://github.com/crowdagger/crowbook) allows you to write a book in Markdown without worrying about formatting or typography, and let the program generate HTML, PDF and EPUB output for you. Very cool project from [Lizzie Crowdagger](https://crowdagger.fr/).

## Opinions

* [Fresh out of prison, I am discovering the good, bad and ugly of technology](https://51st.news/opinion-fresh-out-of-prison-i-am-discovering-the-good-bad-and-ugly-of-technology/)

* [Thrive in obscurity](https://www.jeetmehta.com/posts/thrive-in-obscurity)

> The path to creative mastery begins with years of silence. Publish anyway.

* As much as I love Ubuntu, the recruiting at Canonical is very [bizarre](https://dustri.org/b/my-experience-with-canonicals-interview-process.html).

* [Building a slow web](https://goodinternetmagazine.com/building-a-slow-web/): for the nostalgic and the dreamers. For me.

* I like this website and I liked this article: [My website is ugly because I made it](https://goodinternetmagazine.com/my-website-is-ugly-because-i-made-it/).

* [An Introduction to Un Kyu Lee, creator and designer of the Micro Journal](http://www.thewritekeys.com:8080/unkyuleemj.html)

* The Flask creator (yeah I know he did many things since) writes about his AI revelation: [AI Changes Everything](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/6/4/changes/).

> We are no longer just using machines, we are now working with them.

* A post that was very discussed last week (which means last year in the AI world): [I think I’m done thinking about GenAI for now](https://blog.glyph.im/2025/06/i-think-im-done-thinking-about-genai-for-now.html)

> Instead, I will just have to concede that maybe I’m wrong. I don’t have the skill, or the knowledge, or the energy, to demonstrate with any level of rigor that LLMs are generally, in fact, hot garbage. Intellectually, I will have to acknowledge that maybe the boosters are right. Maybe it’ll be OK.

* Angie Jones talks [how Block operationalized MCP at scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDWqWdLESgY) with [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/). Solid 22 minutes talk.

* I never thought about it, but what a good idea to include Mermaid diagrams in your [AI coding workflow](https://www.robotmunki.com/blog/ai-coding-workflow)!

* [The year on Linux](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-year-on-linux-7f30279e): an open and optimistic piece from David Heinemeier Hansson (BaseCamp, Ruby On Rails), who used Linux and Framework for a year.

> What I've found to work much better is planting seeds and showing off your plowshare. Let whatever curiosity that blooms find its own way towards your blue sky. The mimetic engine of persuasion runs much cleaner anyway.

* [Day of the Devs, Summer 2025 Edition](https://www.youtube.com/live/oEm6wAdqfEY?feature=shared): lots of upcoming creative new video games!
