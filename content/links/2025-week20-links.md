Summary: Week 20

* [Goose and Qwen3 for Local Execution](https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/05/12/local-goose-qwen3/) : steps to run Qwen3 locally, described for zsh but should be straightforward if you use bash. I need to try!

* [Distilled summary of 2024/2025 Google DORA Report](https://www.gitclear.com/research/google_dora_2024_summary_ai_impact)

> [Key finding: AI is having a broad impact](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/2024_final_dora_report.pdf)ï»¿

> "We have observed reductions to software delivery performance, and the effect on product performance is uncertain."

> "Individuals are reporting a decrease in the amount of time they spend doing valuable work as AI adoption increases."

* [Vermilion](https://github.com/vaxerski/Vermilion) is a clean, minimal and simple music player for Spotify (and also MPD & Tidal).

* [Electron ain't bad, actually](https://blog.vaxry.net/articles/2025-electronAintBad): Electron used to be the hype, now it's not but maybe it's unfair.

> What we have to keep in mind is that electron, just like any framework, can be fast, as long as the developer doesn't make it slow. There are many apps based on electron that work really well, for example obsidian or vs code. They show how writing an app in electron doesn't immediately make it slow.

* Related to the recent sweating about the US cybersecurity database being defunded, it's nice to note that [ENISA](https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu/) is now mandated to develop and maintain the European vulnerability database. Yeah Europe!

* [The perverse incentives of Vibe Coding](https://fredbenenson.medium.com/the-perverse-incentives-of-vibe-coding-23efbaf75aee)

> Where an experienced developer might solve a problem with a few elegant lines with a thoughtful functional method, these AI systems often produce verbose, over-engineered solutions that tackle problems incrementally rather than addressing them at their core.

And the key step from the blogpost:

> More tokens processed = more revenue for the company behind the AI

* [Unravelling t-strings](https://snarky.ca/unravelling-t-strings/): new thing in Python 3.14. Looks interesting. For what? An example:

> The most common answer are things like SQL statements and HTML: things that require some processing of what you pass into a template to make sure something isn't going to go awry.

* [Set of tips](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html?m=1) to have a chance to be successful when interviewing for a SW engineer position at, let's say Google.

* How to do a files bulk rename on Ubuntu? It's actually very simple in [Nautilus (the Gnome file manager)](https://anees.in/batch-rename-files-in-nautilus/). Pretty cool feature!

* Why do we better add `./` before calling an executable? [Here](https://www.linfo.org/dot_slash.html) is a comprehensive explanation.

* [AI Doctor Clinic](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/world-s-first-ai-doctor-clinic-wRXR9y6aR0yYsNy0A9_HaQ) are soon to become a reality... Don't be sick.

* Interesting podcast episode about [Building Windsurf](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/building-windsurf-with-varun-mohan) with Varun Mohan, the CEO. He shares the history of the product. Unlike some techbros, he has a more positive and (maybe too) optimistic view on LLMs: for him they allow to deliver better products and should not be used to "reduce the workforce".

That's all folks!
