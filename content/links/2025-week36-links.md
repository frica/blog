Summary: Week 36

Back to work, back to school, back to the links posts.

## Tools

* [How the head of Obsidian went from superfan to CEO](https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/760522/obsidian-ceo-steph-ango-kepano-productivity-software-notes-app): deep dive about Obsidian with Steph Ango and why they're not rushing to add AI buttons everywhere.

* [D2 ASCII output](https://d2lang.com/blog/ascii/): pretty neat! A bit dry output in 2025 but in certain cases so useful.

* [PixiEditor](https://pixieditor.net/): multiplatform, free and versatile 2D editor. Cane be used for pixel art and animated gif.

* [Qwen-Image-Edit](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit): apparently impressive for local AI-assisted image editing. I need to try!

* The DHH video promoting [Omarchy 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcHY0AEd2Uw&t=2s) is pure art. It speaks to all the geeks out there looking for minimalism and efficiency. I’m not sure the project will stand the test of time, but it’s giving me ideas for customizing (and simplifying) my Ubuntu setup.

* A tool to [upgrade your GH actions steps easily](https://github.com/azat-io/actions-up)

* I used `nnn`, now mostly the regular terminal or the Ubuntu explorer but [superfile](https://superfile.netlify.app/getting-started/tutorial/) is extremely nice. Installed it: another set of shortcuts to remember, of course.

* A set of [background patterns for your website](https://patterncraft.fun/). Love the idea of offering so many variations.

* Plenty of [inspiring designs](https://viewport-ui.design/categories/desktop/) (via [sidebar.io](https://sidebar.io)).

* I know you would say "What's the point of having a gigantic cursor on your screen?" but I have a colleague like this so here is how to get [a Wii-like cursor in any OS](https://primmr.dev/projects/wii-pointer-cursors/).

* [ohshitgit](https://ohshitgit.com/): I knew about this webiste, popped up when browsing again, and man it's still so funny.

## Opinions and articles

* [The Good, the Bad, and the Iffy: is there such a thing as an ethical designer?](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/is-there-such-thing-as-an-ethical-designer-creative-industry-280825): a depressing piece if you still have some ideals. Beautiful website BTW.

> There’s also the question of what compromises make possible. Eddie describes big corporate clients as a kind of “Robin Hood mechanism” – the money from bigger players can be the very thing that lets a studio take on riskier, more mission-driven work later.

* An long essay full of insighful, haunting thoughts: [Why I cannot be technical](https://www.fightforthehuman.com/why-i-cannot-be-technical) by Cat Hicks. A must-read, even if Idon't know what to take out of it, apart that being human is a lot of suffering, in Tech or anywhere else.

> That idea of mapping a terrible world and solving some of it is beautiful. Creating safety in someone else’s life is perhaps among the greatest of possible human activities.

* [Rediscovering joy in learning: Jason Lengstorf on the state of development](https://github.blog/developer-skills/career-growth/rediscovering-joy-in-learning-jason-lengstorf-on-the-state-of-development/) is a decent episode of the GitHub podcast. No surprise, Cassidoo is in there...

* [Martin Fowler's AI thoughts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/202508-ai-thoughts.html) are always interesting.

> All an LLM does is produce hallucinations, it’s just that we find some of them useful.

* A good article on [being a manager](https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/08/22/the-management-skill-nobody-talks-about/). I've done all the mistakes, paid a few times the price after, and I'm now much in favor of horizontal hierarchy (if any) and mutual empathy.

> Let me tell you something that will happen after you become a manager: you’re going to mess up. A lot. You’ll give feedback that lands wrong and crushes someone’s confidence. You’ll make a decision that seems logical but turns out to be completely misguided. You’ll forget that important thing you promised to do for someone on your team. You’ll lose your temper in a meeting when you should have stayed calm.

> The real question isn’t whether you’ll make mistakes; it’s what you do after.

* [Static Sites with Python, uv, Caddy, and Docker](https://nkantar.com/blog/2025/08/static-python-uv-caddy-docker/)

* Thread Reddit: [How we vibe-code at a FAANG](https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1myakhd/how_we_vibe_code_at_a_faang/). Good read.

* Google again completely off, released [a journaling app where AI fills in the days for you](https://www.theverge.com/analysis/764519/ai-gemini-pixel-journal-app). Just stop being so stupid.

* The [CUPID principles for joyful coding](https://dannorth.net/blog/cupid-for-joyful-coding/).

* Humble and inspiring [talk from @savannah.dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGXXxGLBVF4) in EuroPython 2025 in Prague on why you CAN help opensource projects even if you think you're not qualified.
