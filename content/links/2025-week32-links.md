Summary: Week 32

After a long pause, I've found the time again to compile some links 😁

## Tools

* [Shai](https://github.com/ovh/shai) is yet another coding agent, made this time by the great people of OVH.

* Cursor goes also in the CLI agentic trend with [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli).

* Same pitch with [Crush](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush) which has at least the originality of being cute.

* [Conveyor CI](https://github.com/open-ug/conveyor): open-source framework for building CI/CD platforms.

* The [ITC Banco Com Font Family](https://font.download/font/itc-banco-com): so popular in France in the 80s.

* [Splash](https://github.com/joshi4/splash): a logs beautifier in Go.

* [Gradia](https://github.com/AlexanderVanhee/Gradia): an app to make beautiful screenshots. Flatpack or Snap.

* [Delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta): fantastic addition to git.

* [ASCIImoon](https://asciimoon.com/): the moon phases in ASCII. Neat.

* [Somo](https://github.com/theopfr/somo): `netstat` but for humans

## Tips and docs

## Opinions

* [6 Weeks of Claude Code](https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/07/30/six-weeks-of-claude-code/)

> If you understand what you are doing, the capacity for building and handling the breadth of tasks which typically live within the remit of “technical debt” do not need to be treated as debt and you can just do it as you are working on other things.

* [I Want Everything Local — Building My Offline AI Workspace](https://instavm.io/blog/building-my-offline-ai-workspace)

> This is more than a just an experiment. It's a philosophy shift bringing compute and agency back to your machine. No cloud dependency. No privacy tradeoffs.

* [How the GitHub billing team uses the coding agent in GitHub Copilot to continuously burn down technical debt](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-the-github-billing-team-uses-the-coding-agent-in-github-copilot-to-continuously-burn-down-technical-debt/)

* [The useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/)

* [Why this matters](https://manuelmoreale.com/why-this-matters) (via [Salma](https://whitep4nth3r.com/))

> Stop being a passive consumer and leave the big platforms behind. Share your dreams and hopes, share your struggles and inner demons. Do it publicly or anonymously. Do it often, or sporadically. But do something. Anything really. The reason why you feel the web is slowly dying is because we're collectively allowing this to happen.

* [My favourite German word](https://vurt.org/articles/my-favourite-german-word/). Gegenstand: something that stands against you

> A self-respecting librarian, confident in their own discipline, says: Here is the library, here is the information; it is arranged so; you will need to learn how it’s arranged, and how it works.

> We should be able to say: this is how documentation is, because this arrangement is part of its integrity, and this is how you must learn to use it and work with it.
