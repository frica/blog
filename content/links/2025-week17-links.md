Summary: Week 17

* Spent a few evenings playing with [wrkflw](https://github.com/bahdotsh/wrkflw). Learned a bit about Docker. Discovered Podman on Linux. I reported 2 bugs and they were both fixed in a couple of days. Nice to see the creator/maintainer listening and fixing issues. It's a bit frustrating that I don't know Rust and can't really comment on the code without the help of a coding agent.

* [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) has become my main terminal on all my computers. It just works. And a few times per month I'm able to spend my free credits to use their master feature: asking on the CLI in natural language :)

* I upgraded my work PC to Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat). Pretty smooth experience. Then of course I tried the gnome extensions and tweaks to make it even fancier. I realized pretty quickly that there was always something broken, inconsistent or not compatible with my monitors setup. Went back to defaults settings (except for some icons)...

* [Npm audit but for Python](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/)

* [Your software is rotting](https://terminal.ahumanfuture.co/posts/2025-04-19/your-software-is-rotting/)

* [NetBSD on the Wii](https://blog.infected.systems/posts/2025-04-21-this-blog-is-hosted-on-a-nintendo-wii/). Yes. Some people are weird in an amazing way.

* Walrus operator! Advanced f-string string formatting! Plenty of big and small things to learn in this article [Advanced Python features](https://blog.edward-li.com/tech/advanced-python-features/)
