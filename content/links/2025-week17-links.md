Summary: Week 17

* [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) from OpenAI, a lightweight coding agent that runs in your terminal

* `git-who` ([link](https://github.com/sinclairtarget/git-who)):

> Unlike git-blame, which can tell you who wrote a line of code, git-who tells you the people responsible for entire components or subsystems in a codebase. You can think of git-who sort of like git-blame but for file trees rather than individual files.

* [Long article](https://blog.glyph.im/2025/04/stop-writing-init-methods.html) about why we should stop with Python `__init__`. Yes I assure you, it can be interesting.

* Facebook motto is [still doing damage](https://blog.glyph.im/2023/12/safer-not-later.html):

> The motto has an implicit preamble, “Once you have done the work to make broken things safe enough, then you should move fast and break things”.

* [wrkflw](https://github.com/bahdotsh/wrkflw), to test your GitHub actions locally. I couldn't make it quite work yet.

* [Do Dumb Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej5RsTtVvQE), the last speech of Armin Ronacher at PyCon Austria 2025

* [Don't have environments](https://alexgaynor.net/2016/jan/19/dont-have-environments/)

> In short, every project should have what Heroku calls “Review Apps”. Every pull request gets its own deployed environment on demand, allowing it to be demoed and reviewed. Pull requests are only merged into master when they are ready to go to production, and they’re reverted if they turn out to have been unready.

* And read this piece from Aftermath: [‘An Overwhelmingly Negative And Demoralizing Force’: What It’s Like Working For A Company That’s Forcing AI On Its Developers](https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney)
