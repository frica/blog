Summary: Week 39

## Tools

* Good news, [Gnome 49](https://release.gnome.org/49/) was released a few days ago! The release notes contains of some yummy stuff and even a section for [developers](https://release.gnome.org/49/developers/index.html). Also thanks to the RN, I discovered [Boxes](https://flathub.org/en/apps/org.gnome.Boxes), a Gnome "VirtualBox" and played with it. Pretty cool software.

* [WinBoat](https://www.winboat.app/): another virtualization software this time aimed at running Windows on your Linux box. Install was not that hard but Windows 11 felt sluggish afterwards. Pity.

* [LazySSH](https://github.com/Adembc/lazyssh?ref=terminaltrove): manage servers directly from the terminal.

* Simon Willinson talks about the [release of Copilot CLI](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/25/github-copilot-cli/#atom-everything).

* [Dysk](https://dystroy.org/dysk/) and [duf](https://github.com/muesli/duf), two better-looking alternatives to the venerable `du`.

* [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit): a toolkit from Github itself "to help you get started with Spec-Driven Development". I had to read it twice to believe it. But OK I'm curious now, I will try once.

## Opinions and articles

* [From 1.2GB to 54MB: My Docker Image Went on a Diet](https://dev.to/hasan_ashab/from-12gb-to-54mb-my-docker-image-went-on-a-diet-apj).

* [Introducing Space Grade Linux](https://lwn.net/Articles/1036168/).

* [Gemini doesn't care what you want](https://geminiprotocol.net/docs/faq-section-7.gm) (and I like it).

* [Good post-mortem about the last npm attack](https://sigh.dev/posts/ctrl-tinycolor-post-mortem/).

* [The babysitter problem](https://chrisbeckman.dev/posts/the-babysitter-problem):

> Claude’s failure wasn’t incompetence, it was architecturally incurious. Debugging isn’t just about trying fixes; it’s about knowing when your whole approach is wrong. That step-back moment is still uniquely human.

* No shit, Sherlock: [Sam Altman says that bots are making social media feel ‘fake’](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/sam-altman-says-that-bots-are-making-social-media-feel-fake/).

* [“Your” vs “My” in user interfaces](https://adamsilver.io/blog/your-vs-my-in-user-interfaces/), interesting read.

* A nice website when art meets web technologies: [field.io](https://field.io/practice).
