Summary: A list of some newsletters that I think are worth it

I got the idea from [Brittany Ellich](https://bsky.app/profile/brittanyellich.com), who reposted a [blog post from Eric Bailey](https://ericwbailey.website/published/newsletters-that-regularly-hit-my-inbox-these-days/), who himself "shamelessly stole this idea from Marc Thiele"... Let's follow this trend üòÅ

## Cassidoo

Newsletter from Cassidy Williams, someone I appreciate for her enthusiasm and who inspired me a lot to start my personal digital space. Links about colorful keyboards, fancy CSS, design and SW articles, basically what she liked in the past days. Also programming riddles and bad puns. Short and refreshing.

## Weird Wide Webhole

Newsletter from [Salma Alam-Naylor](https://whitep4nth3r.com/). Strange, poetic, one-word summary before the link. Excellent.
She even [blogged about it](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/how-to-create-a-newsletter/) and it all makes sense.

## Changelog News

Newsletter from Changelog, a podcast that delivers a weekly curation of reflections, links and tools. Very informative, an important source of reading on top of what I see passing by on Bluesky dev community.

## Pycoder's weekly

If you're interested in Python, this could be a good read. All sorts of SW programming topics, tutorials and project links.
Also the upcoming Python events are listed there (not that I attend these but hey...)

## Pragmatic Engineer

Newsletter from Gergely Orosz. A great read if you like analysis of the latest evolution in the IT world. Long, detailed and thoughtful. 
Unfortunately on Substack but since the newsletter comes into your inbox, you shouldn't notice it. It will push you gently to subscribe to the paying version.

Niche website for CLI tools aficionados, [Terminal Trove](https://terminaltrove.com/explore/) sends also a weekly newsletter.
