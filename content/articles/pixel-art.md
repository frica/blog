Summary: Sunday evening activity

I made some pixel art of me and my daughter ðŸ˜Š

I designed quickly 2 characters with [Pixel Designer](https://mounirtohami.itch.io/pixeldesigner) and imported the png frames into [Piksel](https://www.piskelapp.com).

Result is so cute I added it in the base template.

That was fun!
