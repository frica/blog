Summary: Quote from Peter Adam Boeckel

> If automation dismantles the architecture of work, education must become the architecture of meaning. The challenge is no longer how to prepare people for jobs that may soon vanish, but how to prepare them for a life where purpose is not delivered by employment.

> Peter Adam Boeckel, [The Displacement of Purpose](https://peterboeckel.com/writing/displacementofpurpose)
