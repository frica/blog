Summary: How to change the sort order in the VS Code explorer

For this blog, I use VS Code to write the articles. And often I look at the previous article to either copy paste the basic structure.

So I wanted to see if I could sort the Explorer view based on last modified date and not alphabetically.
VS Code being a very customizable tool, you can!

To do so:

* Open user settings (on Windows and Linux: `Ctrl + ,`)
* Using the settings search bar, search for the following setting ID: `explorer.sortOrder`
* Click the dropdown for that setting and select your preferred sort order (in my case, `modified`)
