Yesterday I attended a [Python user group meeting](https://www.meetup.com/python-user-group-belgium/events/298456368/) in Ghent. It was interesting and I'm glad I joined despite this week being my first in my new position.

They were 3 talks:

* First talk was about Design Patterns in Python: after a brief presentation of the famous book from the [GoF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four), the speaker explained a few patterns that are often used in Python code without necessarily knowing they're patterns. He mentioned the website [python-patterns](https://python-patterns.guide/) as a reference for Python dev who want to know more.

* Second talk was about using testcontainers in Python tests. It uses Docker instances to mimic the behavior of a Postgres database, a Message broker, etc. It looks interesting if you want to write kindof integration tests with minimal setup. Afterwards I found some information [there](https://testcontainers.com/guides/getting-started-with-testcontainers-for-python/).

* Last one was about machine learning and MLOps and at that point I was pretty exhausted. Since I'm ignorant about the topic, the presentation was harder to follow. But the guy was really enthusiastic! He talked about a open-source tool called [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) that seems useful for people building AI/ML models.

Overall a good experience: I didn't feel like a complete fraud 💪🏻 and I enjoyed the impressive office of the company that was hosting 😮!
