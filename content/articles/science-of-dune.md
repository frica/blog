Here is a talk I made for a company event in another life. It's not work-related, it's mine so I can freely share it with the world!

(It also goes along with my desire of putting all my writing and creation in one single place, aka this blog.)

I'm a Dune nerd for a long time. I read the book at the age of 14 (thanks Dad, at least for books you are good). I read the complete series after that, and still have that edition, carried over from place to place for 3 decades. I read the first 2 books multiple times in my life, always with great pleasure.

When the first movie came out, I was *very* excited and it didn't disappoint.
I read at that time a ton of articles of scientists fans of the Dune universe and it gave me the idea of that talk: comparing the science of the book with the actual **real** science.

I'm proud of it because of the efforts and time I put in the documentation efforts and in the format.

So here it is (without the speaker's notes alright, but if you ever want more, let me know üòâ):
