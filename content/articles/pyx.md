Summary: A new player in Python registry landscape

Yesterday, I listened to an interview with Charlie Marsh, the founder of Astral, who brought us `ruff` and `uv`, on an episode of The [Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast/660).

The interview is overall a very good one. I was amazed by the guy, honestly. Simple, to the point, very sweet but confident speech. It was interesting to hear about his background and what motivated him to start working on Python tooling.

BUT I also learned something: Astral is working on its own Python package registry and it's very exciting, given how the previous tools changed so much in the Python world.

I realized after research that this is not brand new, because it already was announced in [August](https://astral.sh/blog/introducing-pyx)! But I missed it, with the holidays and all.

Here how pyx is described in the blog post:

> We think of pyx as an optimized backend for uv: it's a package registry, but it also solves problems that go beyond the scope of a traditional "package registry," making your uv experience faster, more secure, and even GPU-aware. You can use it to host your own internal packages, or as an accelerated, configurable frontend to public sources like PyPI and the PyTorch index.

I don't know if it will be as useful for me personnally than the previous tools but it would be at work, so I registered to [get an early access](https://astral.sh/pyx).

Wait and see...
