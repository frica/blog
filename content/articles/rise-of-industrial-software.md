Summary: Quote from Chris Loy

Discovered via the Dense Discovery newsletter [#376](https://www.densediscovery.com/issues/376):

> The open question, then, is not whether industrial software will dominate, but what that dominance does to the surrounding ecosystem. Previous industrial revolutions externalised their costs onto environments that seemed infinite until they weren’t. Software ecosystems are no different: dependency chains, maintenance burdens, security surfaces that compound as output scales. Technical debt is the pollution of the digital world, invisible until it chokes the systems that depend on it. In an era of mass automation, we may find that the hardest problem is not production, but stewardship. Who maintains the software that no one owns?

I guess you can see it as a good thing (we'll always have a job as software engineers) or a very dark thing (we're wasting our time, energy and resources for something avoidable).

I am a bit on the pessimistic side TBH.
