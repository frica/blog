Summary: Impactful quote from Dense Discovery

Read in the Dense Discovery newsletter [#356](https://www.densediscovery.com/issues/356) a few days ago:

> We know the names of those committing genocide, building the surveillance apparatus and turbo-charging climate collapse. We can see the machine clearly. We can identify its operators, trace its logic, but in a way that clarity only amplifies our panic.

> Every crisis demands systemic transformation, yet we’re offered nothing but empty slogans and incremental lifestyle adjustments. And so we spin frantically between outrage and overwhelm, desperate to act but lacking any meaningful channels for that energy. Directionless panic.

> ― Kai

It's desperate and describes perfectly our times.

But there's always hope.
