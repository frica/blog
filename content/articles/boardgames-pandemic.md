A fun lightning talk I gave 2 years ago at a company event ðŸ˜€

* The intriguing title was supposed to attract people after hours of more serious and corporate presentations (it worked)
* I explained in the talk that I basically played a lot during the COVID era and it helped my mental health. Remote-playing board games regularly with friends gave me something to look forward to and the connection stayed even after the lockdowns
* It was a good opportunity to reflect on my play habits. I showed stats on my logged plays I got from my favorite app [BG stats](https://www.bgstatsapp.com/), coupled with [BoredGamer tools](http://www.boredgamertools.com/).
