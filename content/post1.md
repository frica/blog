We work in an agile fashion in order to get rapid feedback from our users that helps us figure out whether we’re doing the right thing, and to change what we’re doing in order to satisfy their needs.

Feedback cycles have to be short to be valuable. The longer they are, the less we learn from them and the less value users get from our work.

If your stories take 2 weeks (read: 8 days to 8 weeks) to complete, then the value is significantly lower than if they take 2 days.

Short stories create happy customers, happy developers, better code, less waste, and closer connections between developers and the people they’re serving. Think of that the next time you’re trying to decide just how big your next story should be.
