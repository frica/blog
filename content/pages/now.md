# üíº Work

* Learning everyday...

# ü©∫ Health

* No sport, although I know damn well how much I could benefit from it.
* Still struggling with my sleep, because I lack discipline and time for me, so I tend to stay up late.

# üéµ Concerts

* I attended [HellFest](https://hellfest.fr/) in France in June 2025, and saw my friends. Good time.

# ‚ôüÔ∏è Board games

* Last buy, [Zenith](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/424219/zenith): I need to play it more!
* Got [Harmonies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/414317/harmonies) and [Ch√¢teau Combo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/416851/castle-combo), two excellent family games.
* [Happy City](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/319793/happy-city) is still a banger for a quick play.
* We play less than the last years, and mostly only with three, since the teenager rarely wants to participate...
