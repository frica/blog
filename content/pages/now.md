* No sport, but I will try tai-chi end of the month.

# 🎵 Concerts/Shows

* Nothing planned.

# ♟️ Board games

* Last discovery: [Toy Battle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/434654/toy-battle), very smart 2 players area-control game, nicely produced and with a mobile game artistic direction.
* Last buy: [Flip 7](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/420087/flip-7), decent starter game.
