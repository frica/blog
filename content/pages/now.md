Borrowing the concept from [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about), this is the important stuff right now.

# me

* Just back from one great week of holidays.
* Mostly focussed on crafting a cozy personal place on the slow web.

# Blog

* Added this section.
* Adapted the css a bit.

# 💼 Work

* Celebrating my 1 year anniversary @ Bricsys!

# 🩺 Health

* No sport, although I know damn well how much I could benefit from it.
* Still struggling with my sleep, because I lack discipline and time for me, so I tend to stay up late.

# 🎵 Concerts

* I'll attend [HellFest](https://hellfest.fr/) in France in June 2025, mostly to see my friends.

# ♟️ Board games

* Recently bought [Harmonies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/414317/harmonies) and [Château Combo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/416851/castle-combo), two excellent family games.
* [Happy City](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/319793/happy-city) is still a banger for a quick play.
* We play less than the last years, and mostly only with three, since the teenager rarely wants to participate...
