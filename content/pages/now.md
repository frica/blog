# 💼 Work

* Busy period

# 🩺 Health

* No sport, although I know damn well how much I could benefit from it.
* Still struggling with my sleep, because I lack discipline and time for me, so I tend to stay up late.

# 🎵 Concerts

* I'll attend [HellFest](https://hellfest.fr/) in France in June 2025, mostly to see my friends.

# ♟️ Board games

* Recently bought [Harmonies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/414317/harmonies) and [Château Combo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/416851/castle-combo), two excellent family games.
* [Happy City](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/319793/happy-city) is still a banger for a quick play.
* We play less than the last years, and mostly only with three, since the teenager rarely wants to participate...
