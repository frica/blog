# 💼 Work

* Still enjoying it! I like the variety of tasks and being able to code a little.

# 🩺 Health

* No sport, although I know damn well how much I could benefit from it.
* Still struggling with my sleep, because I lack discipline and time for me, so I tend to stay up late.

# 🎵 Concerts

* Seen a couple of hip-hop concerts in the last months, that was nice.

# ♟️ Board games

* Last buy: [Battle of Hoth](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/444481/star-wars-battle-of-hoth), excellent lightweight wargame in the Star Wars universe. Played 11 times already since September.
* New games played recently: [Flip 7](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/420087/flip-7) and [Tsuro](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16992/tsuro) with friends.
