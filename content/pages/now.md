# 💼 Work

* Still enjoying it! I like the variety of tasks and being able to code a little.

# 🩺 Health

* The tai-chi trial lesson was nice!
* Still struggling with my sleep discipline.

# 🎵 Concerts/Shows

* Nothing planned.

# ♟️ Board games

* Nice discovery: [Toy Battle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/434654/toy-battle), very smart 2 players area-control game, nicely produced and with a mobile game artistic direction. [Présages](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/428787/presages) and [Emblèmes](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/451304/emblems) were the last 2 new card-based games and they are both nice!
* Last buy: [Flip 7](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/420087/flip-7), decent starter game.
