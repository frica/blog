Title: About
save_as: pages/about.html

<p>Hi, welcome to my blog! I'm Fabien Rica and I decided to share some stuff with the world on a blog, at a time where blogging may seem irrelevant but is in fact almost an act of resistance. I blogged 20+ years ago when it was hype and nerdy, hence the blog title. I lost everything from that old website when I switched providers and I promised myself to keep the ownership of my blog texts after that.</p>
<p>This serves as: a collection of memories for my foggy brain 🗃️ / a digital garden 🌿 / a scratchpad 📄.</p>
<p>I hope it will help someone one day, in one way or another.</p>
