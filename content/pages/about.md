Title: About
save_as: pages/about.html

<p>Hi, welcome to my blog! I'm Fabien and I decided to share some stuff with the world on a blog, at a time where blogging seems almost irrelevant. I blogged 20+ years ago when it was hype and new and nerdy, hence the blog title.</p>
<p>This will serve as a memory, a scratchpad and will hopefully help someone one day!</p>
